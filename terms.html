        <h2>No Legal Advice; No Attorney–Client Relationship</h2>
        <p>The App and any AI‑generated language, templates, suggestions, or other output (collectively, "Output") are provided for informational and drafting assistance only and do not constitute legal advice, legal opinion, financial advice, or any other professional advice. The App is not a law firm, financial advisor, or other professional services provider, and your use of the App does not create an attorney–client relationship or any other advisory relationship with us or with any other person.

        <h2>Content and Accuracy</h2>
        <p>The App provides document templates, prompts, and AI‑generated text for informational and drafting assistance purposes only. All documents and Output generated by the App are drafts and starting points only and may be incomplete, incorrect, outdated, or inappropriate for your particular situation. While we aim for high‑quality Output, we do not guarantee that any content or Output is complete, correct, up‑to‑date, or suitable as legal, financial, or other professional advice. You are solely responsible for reviewing, editing, and obtaining appropriate independent professional review of any documents you create with the App, and for all consequences of using or relying on those documents.</p>

      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or data, arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the App, any Output, or any documents you create with the App, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total cumulative liability for all claims relating to the App will not exceed the amount you actually paid for the App in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
